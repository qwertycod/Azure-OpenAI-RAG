**Use case :**
The project has info of cost of different kind of interior work in a house like wood work, stone work, plumber, tile etc etc.
The Azure search has indexed all these data as embeddings, so when asked as query it first goes to embedding and get context info and pass this data along when the 
LLM is called to get grounded data.
